<h3>12 September 2017</h3>
<p>We're on a roll! There is now a new option when creating audio file content. You can choose between uploading your own MP3 file, or you can simply enter the address of a SoundCloud page. Hurray! (If you have no idea what that means, not to worry, you probably don't need it. If you do need it it's really handy, though.)</p>

<h3>7 September 2017</h3>
<p>When creating or adding a new page, there is a new option called "hide this page". If you tick this option, the page will not show in the navigation. This can be used while you are working on a page and if you prefer to hide it until it's ready.</p> 
<p>There is also an option to hide a row on a page. You can click on the "cog" icon on a row, and you will see a new "hide this row" option. This will hide the row on the page. This can also be used if you are working on some content but prefer not to show it until it is finished.</p>
